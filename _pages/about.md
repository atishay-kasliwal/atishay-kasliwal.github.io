Developing Meaningful Solutions with Code and Data
======
I am excited to share my journey and skills in the realm of technology as I seek opportunities within your organization. With a robust background in computer science and a passion for leveraging technology to tackle complex challenges, I aim to contribute meaningfully through this portfolio.

Currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Data Science at Stony Brook University, I am deepening my expertise in machine learning, data analytics, statistics, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision. This academic journey not only complements my professional experience but also equips me with the latest methodologies and tools to analyze and interpret data effectively.

In my previous role as a Senior Software Engineer at Accolite Digital, I successfully managed a team of interns, guiding them through projects while ensuring quality deliverables. My responsibilities included participating in the hiring process, evaluating candidates, and contributing to building a strong team. I led various projects that involved designing and implementing innovative software solutions, ultimately improving efficiency and user experience. My experience with serverless applications and cloud services, particularly AWS, enabled me to create scalable architectures tailored to diverse client needs.

During my internship at Shriffle, I gained valuable hands-on experience in a dynamic environment, contributing to the development of web applications and collaborating closely with cross-functional teams. This role enhanced my technical skills in Python and JavaScript and reinforced the importance of teamwork and communication in delivering successful projects.

My academic background includes a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Information Technology, where I studied data structures and algorithms, data visualization, data mining, and statistics. This foundational knowledge has been instrumental in deriving insights from complex datasets and presenting them in an accessible manner.

I possess a strong foundation in algorithms and system architecture and am adept at using data visualization tools and databases, including SQL and NoSQL systems. My work on customer segmentation projects and analytical studies has honed my ability to interpret data and communicate findings effectively.

Through this portfolio, I hope to showcase my projects and experiences that reflect my dedication to driving innovation and delivering impactful solutions. I am particularly drawn to organizations that value creativity and collaboration and look forward to discussing how my background aligns with your team's needs.
