Lockdown has affected the population in many different ways, may it be financially or mentally. Opening the lockdown was an essential step as a lot of people were losing their jobs but that doesn’t mean COVID19 has disappeared. People in different areas were hit with different intensities, like people in containment zone experienced things differently than people who were not in containment zone. So, we used the same attribute for the classification of our survey response dataset, to make it easier to predict their viewpoint. It also helps to know where people or the government is lacking is creating a safe environment, even when they are somewhat successful. Different Data Analysis strategies and Machine Learning models were used to predict the target. Our data set has more than 600 instances and approximately 31 questions in context of the experience of people during lockdown with respect to their observations about other people and government duties.
