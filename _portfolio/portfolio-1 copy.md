title: "Walmart Sales Prediction"
excerpt: "Data Science Project in python to predict the sales for each department using historical markdown data from the Walmart dataset containing data of 45 Walmart stores. The purpose of this project is to develop a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a given Walmart store. This project features a exploratory analysis and my predictive model was primarily based on linear regression<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"

This project aims to predict weekly sales for each department across 45 Walmart stores using historical markdown data. The core objective was to develop a robust predictive model to estimate sales performance, leveraging various analytical and machine learning techniques. Key highlights of the project include:

* Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset, focusing on key factors such as markdown events, holiday periods, and economic indicators.
* Utilized linear regression as the primary predictive model to estimate weekly sales, generating a line of best fit to predict future data points based on historical trends.
* Developed a strategy to identify the impact of holiday markdown events on different departments and quantified the extent of this impact.
* Implemented dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA) to reduce prediction error, minimize overfitting, and enhance the generalization of the model.
* Applied shrinkage methods to optimize the predictive performance and improve the accuracy of sales forecasts, balancing model complexity and predictive power.
* This project effectively combined data-driven insights and machine learning to deliver actionable sales predictions for Walmart, highlighting key business drivers and markdown strategies influencing sales trends.
