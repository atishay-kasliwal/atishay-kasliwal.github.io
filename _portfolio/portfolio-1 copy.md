This project aims to predict weekly sales for each department across 45 Walmart stores using historical markdown data. The core objective was to develop a robust predictive model to estimate sales performance, leveraging various analytical and machine learning techniques. Key highlights of the project include:

* Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset, focusing on key factors such as markdown events, holiday periods, and economic indicators.
* Utilized linear regression as the primary predictive model to estimate weekly sales, generating a line of best fit to predict future data points based on historical trends.
* Developed a strategy to identify the impact of holiday markdown events on different departments and quantified the extent of this impact.
* Implemented dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA) to reduce prediction error, minimize overfitting, and enhance the generalization of the model.
* Applied shrinkage methods to optimize the predictive performance and improve the accuracy of sales forecasts, balancing model complexity and predictive power.
* This project effectively combined data-driven insights and machine learning to deliver actionable sales predictions for Walmart, highlighting key business drivers and markdown strategies influencing sales trends.
